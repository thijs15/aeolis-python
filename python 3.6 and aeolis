When using python v3.6 I had to change the follwoing code in the model.py script in the aeolis module

In def load_restartfile(self, restartfile): 

Search for 

	with open(restartfile, 'r') as fp:

                    state = pickle.load(fp)

Replace for

	with open(restartfile, 'rb') as fp:

                    state = pickle.load(fp, encoding ='bytes')



In def dump_restartfile(self):

Search for 

with open(restartfile, 'w') as fp:		

Replace for

with open(restartfile, 'wb') as fp:

possible better solution is to implement following code in model.py

if (sys.version_info > (3, 0)):
    with open(restartfile, 'wb') as fp:
else:
    with open(restartfile, 'w') as fp:
